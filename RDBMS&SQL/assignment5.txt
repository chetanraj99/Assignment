--How query performance can be improved by using index:
Indexes improve query performance by allowing the database to find rows more quickly without scanning the entire table.
in case of indexing binary search applied where time complexity goes upto O(logn).

--creating index:
CREATE INDEX idx_isbn ON Books(ISBN);

--Improvement in Query Performance:
SELECT * FROM Books WHERE ISBN = '978-3-16-148410-0';
//With the index, the database quickly locates the row using the ISBN index rather than scanning the entire table.

--droping index:
DROP INDEX idx_isbn ON Books;

--Without the index same query:
SELECT * FROM Books WHERE ISBN = '978-3-16-148410-0';

//will require a full table scan, significantly slowing down performance, especially for large tables.
