Project: Development of a new medical device to monitor blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes.
SDLC phases:
1. Requirements gathering and analysis:
The project team met with stakeholders, including doctors, nurses, and patients with diabetes, to understand their needs 
and requirements for the new device. The team also reviewed existing medical devices and literature on blood glucose 
monitoring.
2. Design:
The project team developed a detailed design for the new device, including its features, functionality, and user interface. The team also created a prototype of the device to test its usability and functionality.
3. Implementation:
The project team developed the new device according to the design specifications. The team also developed software to 
operate the device and collect and analyze data from the device.
4. Testing:
The project team tested the new device to ensure that it met all requirements and was safe and effective for use. The 
team conducted both internal and external testing, including clinical trials with patients with diabetes.
5. Deployment:
The project team deployed the new device to hospitals and clinics. The team also provided training to healthcare 
professionals on how to use the device.
6. Maintenance:
The project team continues to maintain the new device and provide support to healthcare professionals. The team also 
collects feedback from users and makes improvements to the device as needed.
