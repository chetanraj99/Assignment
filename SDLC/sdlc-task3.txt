***Waterfall Model:

Advantages:
Simple and easy to understand.
Well suited for projects where requirements are well-defined and unlikely to change.
Each phase has specific deliverables, making it easy to measure progress.
Disadvantages:
Lack of flexibility: difficult to accommodate changes once a phase is completed.
Limited customer involvement until the end of the project.
Testing is typically performed at the end, which can lead to late detection of defects.
Applicability: Suitable for projects with stable requirements and a clear understanding of the end product, such as 
in traditional engineering projects like construction or manufacturing.


***Agile Model:

Advantages:
Highly flexible and adaptive to changing requirements.
Encourages customer collaboration and feedback throughout the development process.
Allows for incremental delivery, which enables early validation of features.
Disadvantages:
Requires active customer involvement, which may not always be feasible.
Lack of documentation can lead to knowledge gaps, especially in large teams or long-term projects.
May result in scope creep if not managed properly.
Applicability: Ideal for projects where requirements are likely to change or evolve, such as software development or 
prototyping in engineering contexts.


***Spiral Model:

Advantages:
Incorporates risk management throughout the project lifecycle.
Allows for iterative development and prototyping.
Well-suited for projects with high uncertainty or evolving requirements.
Disadvantages:
Can be complex and difficult to manage, especially for small projects.
Requires significant expertise in risk management and iteration planning.
May lead to schedule and cost overruns if risks are not managed effectively.
Applicability: Suitable for projects where early risk identification and mitigation are critical, such as in complex 
engineering systems or software projects with evolving requirements.


***V-Model:

Advantages:
Emphasizes testing throughout the development lifecycle, leading to early defect detection.
Provides a systematic approach to ensure that each stage has corresponding testing activities.
Well-suited for projects with stringent quality requirements or regulatory compliance.
Disadvantages:
Can be rigid and less adaptable to changes compared to Agile or Spiral models.
Limited customer involvement until the later stages of development.
May result in higher upfront costs due to extensive planning and testing activities.
Applicability: Suitable for projects where quality assurance and verification are paramount, such as in safety-critical
 systems or highly regulated industries like aerospace or medical devices.
