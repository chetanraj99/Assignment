*******Test Driven Development (TDD)

Approach:

Illustration: Programmer writing test cases before coding.
Brief description: "Write failing test cases based on desired behavior, then write code to make tests pass."
Benefits:

Reduced bugs
Improved software reliability
Faster development cycles
Suitability:

Illustration: Various software development scenarios (e.g., web development, mobile app development, embedded systems).
Brief description: "Best suited for projects where requirements are clear and well-defined."



Section 2: Behavior Driven Development (BDD)

Approach:

Illustration: Collaboration between developers, testers, and business stakeholders to define behavior through examples.
Brief description: "Define behavior using natural language examples (given, when, then), then automate tests based on
these scenarios."
Benefits:

Improved collaboration
Enhanced understanding of requirements
Focus on business value
Suitability:

Illustration: Teams collaborating in different business domains (e.g., finance, healthcare, e-commerce).
Brief description: "Ideal for projects where business stakeholders need to be closely involved in the development 
process."



Section 3: Feature Driven Development (FDD)

Approach:

Illustration: Iterative development process focusing on features and their corresponding models.
Brief description: "Divide development into manageable feature sets, then plan, design, and build features iteratively."
Benefits:

Emphasis on feature delivery
Scalability for large projects
Clear progress tracking
Suitability:

Illustration: Large-scale development projects with complex feature sets (e.g., enterprise software, ERP systems).
Brief description: "Suited for projects with a large number of features and a need for structured development."
