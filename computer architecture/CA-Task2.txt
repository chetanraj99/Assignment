ASSIGNMENT :- identify a real world application for both parallel computing and network system explain how this technologies are used
 and why they are important in the context.

Parallel Computing:

Real World Application: Weather Forecasting

How it's Used: Weather forecasting involves complex mathematical models and simulations to predict future weather patterns. 
Parallel computing is used to divide these computations into smaller tasks that can be processed simultaneously by multiple 
processors or cores. Each processor works on a different part of the simulation, and the results are combined to generate 
accurate forecasts in a shorter amount of time.

Importance: Parallel computing significantly accelerates the speed of weather forecasting models, allowing meteorologists to
 generate forecasts faster. This is crucial for providing timely and accurate information to the public, government agencies, 
and industries such as agriculture, aviation, and shipping, which rely on weather predictions for decision-making.

Network Systems:

Real World Application: Online Retail

How it's Used: In online retail, network systems play a vital role in facilitating transactions between customers and vendors.
 When a customer visits an online store, their request is processed by a network of servers and databases that handle tasks 
such as displaying product information, processing orders, managing inventory, and handling payments. Network systems ensure 
seamless communication between these components, enabling a smooth shopping experience for customers.

Importance: Network systems are essential for the success of online retail businesses. They enable scalability, allowing 
businesses to handle increasing numbers of customers and transactions without sacrificing performance. Additionally, 
network systems support features such as real-time inventory updates, personalized recommendations, and secure payment 
processing, which are critical for enhancing the customer experience and driving sales.
