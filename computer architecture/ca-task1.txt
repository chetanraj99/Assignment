Assignment 1: Draw your Home Network Topology and explain how you are Unde accessing the RPS Lab environment
Internet Gateway/Router: This is the device provided by your internet service provider (ISP) that connects your home network to the internet.

Switch/Wi-Fi Router: This device provides local network connectivity to your various devices, both wired and wireless.
Computers and Devices: These are your personal computers, smartphones, tablets, smart home devices, etc., connected to your local network.

 






VPN (Virtual Private Network): Your organization may provide a VPN service that allows you to securely connect to their network from anywhere with internet access.
 You would install VPN client software on your computer or device, then connect to the VPN using your credentials. This establishes a secure, encrypted connection 
to your organization's network.

Access Control: Once connected to the VPN, you may need to authenticate yourself further (e.g., with a username and password) 
to access specific resources within your organization's network, such as the RPS Lab environment.
